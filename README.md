# Olkin_CSCI2270_FinalProject
This is a robotics team drafting simulator, where you can recruit robots from a pool and add them to your list of teams.
Users will be able to add teams to their list and delete teams from their lists, as well as sort them by different means values (such as name, year established, and offensive power)
